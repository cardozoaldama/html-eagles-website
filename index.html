    <h2>About a history</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, in a hidden corner of a mystical forest, there existed a species of majestic creatures known as
        giant eagles. These magnificent birds possessed wingspans that stretched across the sky, making them a sight to
        behold. With feathers as golden as the sun, they soared gracefully through the air, their sharp eyes scanning
        the land below.</p>
